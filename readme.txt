A simple template linked list. 
List is singly linked and utilizes "smart nodes" as opposed to implementing linkedlist methods with temporary nodes.
This list supports the following methods:
prepend()   //Puts node at the head of list.
append()    //Puts node at the tail of list
remove()    //Removes a node
search()    //Searches list for node with appropriate data value.
size()      //Returns the number of elements in the list
print()     //Prints contents of the list to console in order starting from the Head
toString()  //returns the contents of the list as a string in the same order as print()
pop()       //returns a node's value, then deletes the node
