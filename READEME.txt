DESCRIPTION: Template Linked List. Singly linked with a head but no tail. Supports basic linked list functions such as append, prepend, remove, search, print , etc. Implements "smart nodes" (i.e nodes with methods of their own that complement and help the classes methods) as opposed to "dumb nodes" (i.e nodes without methods of their own; class methods would need to be carried out with pointers to the head and iterating it through the list)
